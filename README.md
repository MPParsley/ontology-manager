## Dev Setup

### A. GitHub Setup

1. Create an OAuth app: https://github.com/settings/applications/new
1. Homepage / Callback : `http://localhost:3000/`
1. Fill the env vars in `.env`:
    ```
    OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=6bac5524e0e11f1ae9ec
    OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=b5d15ea361b1d28a44152599c72621a36c631751
    ```

### B. Local Setup

1. `npm install`
1. Run the project:
  * Database:
      * `make up` (If the database is booting up for the first time, you'll see migrations being retried until DB is up and they get applied.)
  * Front dev server + watch:
      * If you only want to watch the front (you probably do): `npm run dev`
      * If you want to watch the front AND the API: `npm run dev-api`

Whenever you feel like it:

* Deleting the DB to start over:
    * `make reset`

## Architecture

### 2 Services

1. A Postgres Database
1. A web backend made of:
    * A Nuxt app, using Apollo as GraphQL client.
    * A Nuxt Server Middleware implemented as an Express API
        * This is where the forge-specific functionality (GitHub, GitLab, â€¦) is implemented
        * Configurable via `nuxt.config.js`
    * A GraphQL API backed by Postgres, schema generated by introspecting the pg schema

### Concepts and Implementation Overview

#### Threads

* A thread is a conversation, messages belong to a thread.
* A thread has a type, at the moment a thread can either be a `discussion` or a `proposal`.

#### PR

* A PR is a Pull Request or Merge Request.
* A PR is created by a system account hitting the Forge API.
* Creating a PR is roughly:
    1. Create a branch based on `master`, give it a unique name.
    1. Apply the proposed changes to the files on this branch.
    1. Create a commit attributed to the original author, push the branch to the origin.
    1. Open a PR targeting `master`, retrieve the PR `id`, store it as `thread.external_id`.

### To Consider

* ~~Should the forge-specific functionalities be implemented as a GraphQL endpoint?~~
  * How does Apollo support multiple endpoints?
    * GitHub GraphQL API is not complete enough anyway.

### Helpful Tools

- Vue devtools extension [Chrome, Firefox](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-devtools#installation)
- Local GraphQL IDE: [Graph*i*QL `http://localhost:5000/graphiql`](http://localhost:5000/graphiql)
- A postgres client (e.g. [Postico](https://eggerapps.at/postico/) for MacOS) to inspect schemas and data
- Apollo devtools extension [Chrome, Firefox](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client-devtools#apollo-client-devtools)
